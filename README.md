## My data wrangling and visulization
### 1. [Data Analysis of the “War of the Five Kings”](https://github.com/YX-SYD/Data-Wrangling-Visulization/blob/master/war-of-five-kings/Game_of_thrones_battle_analysis.ipynb) - Game of Thrones. <br/>
Through extensive EDA, I answered the following questions:
- Which year has the most battles?
- Which region sees the largest number of battles?
- Which king attacks most? Which king wins the most battles as an attacker?
- Which battle type is more common?What battle styles are used by each attacker king.
- The impact of army size.
- The impact of season.
- How many commanders are owned by each attacker king?
- Which commander leads most battles as an attacker commander?Who are the commanders with the most victories of each attacker king?
Does the major house fight alone or with allies in attacker side?
